JavaScript modules are reusable pieces of code that can be exported from one program and imported for use in another program.
```
let Airplane = {};

Airplane.myAirplane = "StarJet";

module.exports = Airplane;

//
const Airplane = require('./1-airplane.js');

function displayAirplane() {
  console.log(Airplane.myAirplane);
}

displayAirplane();
```
//StarJet


export default
Node.js supports require()/module.exports, but as of ES6, JavaScript supports a new more readable and flexible syntax for exporting modules. These are usually broken down into one of two techniques, default export and named exports.

```
export let availableAirplanes = [
{name: 'AeroJet',
 fuelCapacity: 800,
 availableStaff: ['pilots', 'flightAttendants', 'engineers', 'medicalAssistance', 'sensorOperators'],
 maxSpeed: 1200,
 minSpeed: 300
}, 
{name: 'SkyJet',
 fuelCapacity: 500,
 availableStaff: ['pilots', 'flightAttendants'],
 maxSpeed: 800,
 minSpeed: 200
}
];

export let flightRequirements = {
  requiredStaff: 4,
  requiredSpeedRange: 700
};

export function meetsStaffRequirements(availableStaff, requiredStaff) {
  if (availableStaff.length >= requiredStaff) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};

export function meetsSpeedRangeRequirements(maxSpeed, minSpeed, requiredSpeedRange) {
  let range = maxSpeed - minSpeed;
  if (range > requiredSpeedRange) {
    return true;
    } else {
    return false;
  }
};

export default meetsSpeedRangeRequirements;
```


Named Exports
ES6 introduced a second common approach to export modules. In addition to export default, named exports allow us to export data through the use of variables.

Letâ€™s see how this works. In menu.js we would be sure to give each piece of data a distinct variable name:

let specialty = '';
function isVegetarian() {
}; 
function isLowSodium() {
}; 

export { specialty, isVegetarian };
Notice that, when we use named exports, we are not setting the properties on an object. Each export is stored in its own variable.
specialty is a string object, while isVegetarian and isLowSodium are objects in the form of functions. Recall that in JavaScript, every function is in fact a function object.
export { specialty, isVegetarian }; exports objects by their variable names. Notice the keyword export is the prefix.
specialty and isVegetarian are exported, while isLowSodium is not exported, since it is not specified in the export syntax.

Export Named Exports
Named exports are also distinct in that they can be exported as soon as they are declared, by placing the keyword export in front of variable declarations.

In menu.js

export let specialty = '';
export function isVegetarian() {
}; 
function isLowSodium() {
}; 
The export keyword allows us to export objects upon declaration, as shown in export let specialty and export function isVegetarian() {}.
We no longer need an export statement at the bottom of our file, since this behavior is handled above.
